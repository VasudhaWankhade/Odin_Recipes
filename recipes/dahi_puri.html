    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dahi Puri is a popular Indian street food where golgappas (fried small balls made from semolina/flour) are filled with potato, cilantro chutney, tamarind chutney, yogurt and sprinkled with spices. It is crunchy yet soft from the inside and is like
        a flavor explosion in the mouth. Itâ€™s hard to stop at one when it comes to Dahi Puri!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 & 1/2 cups plain yogurt mixed with 4 tablespoon water and 2 teaspoons sugar (I used whole milk full fat yogurt)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup boiled & cubed potato cut into small cubes</li>
        <li>1/3 cup onion chopped</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cilantro chutney or more as needed</li>
        <li>1/4 cup tamarind chutney or more as needed</li>
        <li>15-20 golgappe/panipuri store bought or homemade</li>
        <li>cumin powder, black salt to sprinkle, as needed</li>
        <li>chaat masala, red chili powder to sprinkle, as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon nylon sev thin sev</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped cilantro</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Arrange the golgappas on a serving plate. Carefully break each golgappa in the center using your fingers. This is to make space for all the filling.</li>
        <li>Add the boiled potato cubes to each of the golgappa. Make sure to chop the potato into small pieces. Then add the chopped onion.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cumin powder, black salt, chaat masala, and red chili powder over the top of each golgappa.</li>
        <li>Then fill each golgappa with cilantro chutney, followed by tamarind chutney. You can add around 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of each, this depends on the size of golgappas you are using.</li>
        <li>Then fill each golgappa with the prepared yogurt. Add lot of yogurt, since this is dahi puri, yogurt has to be the star ingredient.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle cumin powder, black salt (kala namak), chaat masala, and red chili powder again on top of the yogurt.</li>
        <li>Top with nylon sev and then with chopped cilantro. Serve dahi puri immediately else it will get soggy.</li>
    </ol>
